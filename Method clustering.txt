Method: clustering

The method clustering is a way to assign the road inspectors over the entire network based on the data of the incidents. Initially a random point of the network is assigned as a location of a road inspector. Then a predetermined group of data points, which are locations of incidents, are assigned to the road inspector location closest to that point. Then an iterative process starts until the clusters are optimized to have the shortest absolute distance from an incident location from the data to a road inspector location. For this optimization two types of clustering methods are used. In the first method the road inspector locations are based on centroid, which is the average of all the data points in the cluster of this centroid. The second method is based on medoid’s and here the road inspector locations must be on the same location as one of the incident data locations. 

The method of assigning road inspectors to locations on the road network is less complicated with the clustering method compared to the shortest-path method. In this implementation of the clustering method the geometry of the roads is not taken into account. By adding this the distance between the medoid and the incident location is more accurate and clusters can be assigned based on the road network instead of the absolute distance. The use of medoid’s instead of centroids is already an improvement because the road inspectors are then actually placed on a road and not on a random location. What needs to be taken into account here is that some incident data points are not on the roads of the network provided (from Rijkswaterstaat). This means that even a medoid is not guaranteed to be on the road network. A low effort solution for this is to manually correct the centroid or medoid.
